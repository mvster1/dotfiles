# My Dotfiles for Fedora 42

These are my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for a customized desktop experience on Fedora 42. This setup is built around the **bspwm** window manager, providing a lightweight and keyboard-driven workflow.

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary configuration files to replicate my setup, including settings for the window manager, terminal, panel, and various other applications. The main goal is to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing environment for development and general use.

### Key Components

* **Window Manager**: [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) - A tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree.
* **Hotkey Daemon**: [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) - A simple X hotkey daemon for bspwm.
* **Panel**: [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) - A fast and easy-to-use status bar.
* **Terminal Emulator**: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - A fast, feature-rich, GPU-based terminal emulator.
* **Application Launcher**: Rofi (inferred, common with bspwm) - A window switcher, application launcher, and dmenu replacement.
* **Compositor**: [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) - A lightweight compositor for X11 (previously Compton).
* **Shell**: [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - A powerful and customizable shell.
* **GTK Theme**: Custom GTK-2.0, GTK-3.0, and GTK-4.0 settings for a consistent look and feel across applications.
* **Icons**: Custom icon theme.
* **Text Editor**: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - A hyperextensible Vim-based text editor.
* **Multiplexer**: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) - A terminal multiplexer.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/mvster1/dotfiles.git
    ```

2.  **Run the post-installation script:**
    This script will install all the necessary packages and create symbolic links for the configuration files.
    ```bash
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./postinstall.sh
    ```
    *Review the `postinstall.sh` script before running it to ensure it aligns with your system and desired changes.*
